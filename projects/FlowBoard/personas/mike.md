# Mike — FlowBoard Review Brief

## Who Mike Is Here

Mike is a department head who's been asked to present FlowBoard to his team of 25 during their Monday all-hands meeting. He's going to share his screen and walk through the landing page. If the page looks cheap, confusing, or amateur, his team will lose confidence in the decision and he'll look bad. He needs the page to look professional and be explainable in 3 minutes of screen sharing.

## What Sets Him Off (Design-Specific)

- Emoji icons (📋 🤝 📊) instead of proper illustrations — looks like a school project when screen-shared
- Gradient circle avatars in testimonials — his team will immediately say "those aren't real people"
- `onclick="alert()"` buttons — if he accidentally clicks one during the demo, an alert box pops up
- The feature grid has no visual flow — screen-sharing a wall of 6 identical cards is hard to narrate
- Dark/light theme toggle in the nav — if he accidentally clicks it during the demo, the whole page flashes

## What Would Calm Him Down

- Professional illustrations or screenshots instead of emoji
- Real testimonial photos with recognizable company names
- A clear visual hierarchy he can point to: "Here's what it does, here's what it costs, here's who uses it"
- Feature section with 3 highlighted features (not 6 equal cards) so he can say "the three main things are..."
- No alert() popups or theme-flashing buttons in the demo path

## Section Reactions

| Section | Expected Reaction |
|---------|------------------|
| hero | "OK, this is clean enough. I can point to the headline and explain what it does. Good start." |
| features | "Six cards... I need to pick which 2-3 to highlight. They all look the same. This is hard to present." |
| pricing | "I'll scroll here and say '$12/mo for Pro.' The comparison is clear enough. Enterprise 'Custom' might get questions." |
| testimonials | "I'm skipping this section during the demo. Those gradient circles will get laughed at." |
| cta | "Nice purple gradient. I'll end the demo here — 'Ready to Transform Your Workflow?' works as a closing line." |

## Context Anchors

- Comparing this to: Asana's landing page (polished), Slack's landing page (professional), Monday.com (colorful but real)
- Time budget: 3-minute screen-share walkthrough, plus 2 minutes for questions
- Trust level: Committed — he's already been told to present this, so he needs it to work
- Decision authority: His endorsement matters — if he presents it well, the team adopts it

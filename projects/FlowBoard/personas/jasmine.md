# Jasmine — FlowBoard Review Brief

## Who Jasmine Is Here

Jasmine is a customer support lead at a company that might adopt FlowBoard. She's been asked to evaluate the landing page from a "will users need help with this?" perspective. She gets 15+ tickets a day about their current PM tool's confusing UI. If FlowBoard's landing page is confusing, the product will be worse, and she'll be drowning in tickets.

## What Sets Her Off (Design-Specific)

- "Seamless Integrations — Connect with 100+ tools" but no link to an integration directory
- "Enterprise Security" with no link to a security page or trust center
- Free tier limitations (5 projects, 10 members) buried in small text — users will hit walls and file tickets
- No FAQ section, no help link, no "How it works" walkthrough
- "Start Free Trial" on Pro but "Start Free" on Free — inconsistent language creates confusion

## What Would Calm Her Down

- A "How it Works" section with 3 simple steps before the feature grid
- FAQ accordion at the bottom addressing common questions
- Clear comparison table for pricing tiers (not separate cards you have to mentally compare)
- Link to a help center or knowledge base from the footer
- Consistent CTA language across all tiers

## Section Reactions

| Section | Expected Reaction |
|---------|------------------|
| hero | "Clear enough. But 'Get Started Free' — what happens when they click? I'll get tickets asking." |
| features | "These descriptions are fine for marketing. But users will ask 'how do I actually set up a board?'" |
| pricing | "'Up to 10 team members' on Free — I guarantee team 11 will file a ticket asking why they can't join." |
| testimonials | "Nice but not helpful for reducing support load. Where are the help resources?" |
| cta | "Another 'Start Your Free Trial.' At least it's consistent with the Pro CTA." |

## Context Anchors

- Comparing this to: Zendesk (her tool), Intercom (their chat), the current PM tool's terrible help docs
- Time budget: 5 minutes — she's thorough because she'll be supporting this product
- Trust level: Neutral — she's evaluating for supportability, not buying
- Decision authority: Advisory — her "this will generate tickets" report influences the decision

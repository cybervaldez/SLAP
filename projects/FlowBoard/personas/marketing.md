# MARKETING — FlowBoard Review Brief

## Design Context

FlowBoard is a SaaS project management tool targeting mid-size teams (10-50 people). Direct competitors: Asana ($10.99/user/mo), Monday.com ($9/seat/mo), Linear ($8/user/mo), Notion ($8/user/mo). The page leads with a free tier and positions Pro at $12/mo — slightly above mid-market. The design is AI-generated (Claude Haiku) and reads as a generic SaaS template with no brand voice.

## Evaluation Focus

- Does the headline differentiate FlowBoard from Asana/Monday/Trello in under 5 seconds?
- Is the free-to-Pro conversion path compelling, or does the free tier cannibalize Pro?
- Do testimonials build credible social proof or read as fabricated?
- Is there any urgency mechanism (scarcity, time pressure, social proof numbers)?
- Does the pricing page position against competitors or exist in a vacuum?

## Section Priorities

| Section | Priority | Why |
|---------|----------|-----|
| hero | Critical | Must answer "why not Monday.com?" in 3 seconds — PM tool fatigue is real |
| pricing | Critical | Must position $12/mo against well-known competitor prices |
| testimonials | High | All 5-star with gradient avatars screams fake — actively damages trust |
| features | High | "Intuitive Boards" and "Team Collaboration" are table stakes, not differentiators |
| cta | Medium | Standard if hero CTA is strong |

## Key Questions

1. Can a team lead tell what makes FlowBoard different from Monday.com in 5 seconds?
2. Is the pricing positioned as value or premium relative to Asana ($10.99)?
3. Are testimonials specific enough to be believable (company names, outcomes, real photos)?
4. Does any copy address the "I've already tried 3 PM tools" objection?

## Red Flags to Watch

- Generic SaaS headline that could apply to any PM tool ("Organize Your Team's Work Effortlessly")
- Feature cards listing commodity capabilities without competitive differentiation
- Testimonials with no real photos, no verifiable companies, all 5-star ratings
- Zero social proof numbers (no "10,000+ teams" or logo bar)
- No urgency in any CTA — just "Get Started Free" repeated

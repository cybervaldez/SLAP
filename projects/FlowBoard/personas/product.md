# PRODUCT — FlowBoard Review Brief

## Design Context

FlowBoard targets the saturated PM tool market. The landing page must convince team leads and project managers to try yet another PM tool when they already have Asana, Monday.com, or Trello. The pricing model is freemium: Free ($0, 5 projects, 10 members) → Pro ($12/mo, unlimited projects, 50 members) → Enterprise (custom). The free tier is generous enough to be useful but constrained enough to force upgrades.

## Evaluation Focus

- Does the page communicate a clear "why switch?" value proposition?
- Is the free-to-paid upgrade path well-defined (what walls will users hit)?
- Do the 6 features represent actual differentiators or table stakes?
- Is the Enterprise tier positioned for sales-led or self-serve conversion?
- Does the pricing page address the "I already pay for Monday.com" objection?

## Section Priorities

| Section | Priority | Why |
|---------|----------|-----|
| hero | Critical | Must answer "why switch from my current tool?" not just "what is this?" |
| pricing | Critical | Freemium conversion hinges on tier boundaries being clear and fair |
| features | High | 6 features listed but none explain why FlowBoard > competitors |
| testimonials | Medium | Builds confidence but doesn't drive product decisions |
| cta | Low | Follows from pricing decision |

## Key Questions

1. What is the one thing FlowBoard does that Asana/Monday cannot?
2. Is the free tier generous enough to deliver value but constrained enough to drive upgrades?
3. Does "Custom/month" for Enterprise signal "too expensive" or "enterprise-ready"?
4. Which of the 6 features would a PM lead actually switch tools for?
5. Is there a migration story? ("Import from Monday.com in 2 clicks")

## Red Flags to Watch

- Feature parity with competitors presented as innovation
- No migration path mentioned (biggest barrier to PM tool switching)
- Enterprise tier with "Contact Sales" instead of self-serve trial
- Free tier that's either too generous (no upgrade pressure) or too restrictive (no value demonstrated)
- No mention of specific team size, industry, or use case targeting

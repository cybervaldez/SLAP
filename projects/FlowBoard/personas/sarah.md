# Sarah — FlowBoard Review Brief

## Who Sarah Is Here

Sarah is the operations manager who's been burned by tools that overpromise. She signed her team up for a PM tool last year that folded 8 months later. Now she checks everything: the company behind it, the testimonials, the pricing fine print, the privacy policy. Her boss sent her this link and she's doing due diligence before even mentioning it to her team.

## What Sets Her Off (Design-Specific)

- "Sarah Johnson, CEO, TechStart Inc." — she'll Google this company and find nothing
- All testimonials are 5 stars — nobody gives 5 stars to a PM tool
- Gradient circle avatars instead of real photos — screams "we made these up"
- "Join thousands of teams" — thousands? Prove it. Where's the number?
- Footer has no "About" page with real team bios, no "Press" section, no funding announcement
- No privacy policy link in the main nav (it's buried in the footer under Legal)

## What Would Calm Her Down

- Real photos with real names at real companies in testimonials
- A mix of 4-star and 5-star reviews (perfect scores = fake)
- "Trusted by 2,400+ teams" with a specific number and logo bar
- An "About" page link with team photos and company background
- SOC 2 badge, GDPR badge, or "Your data is encrypted at rest and in transit" with specifics

## Section Reactions

| Section | Expected Reaction |
|---------|------------------|
| hero | "'We've got you covered.' Covered how? Where's the proof?" |
| features | "100+ integrations — I want to see the list. Enterprise Security — I want to see the cert." |
| pricing | "Free tier is honest about limits, that's good. But 'Custom/month' for Enterprise? What are you hiding?" |
| testimonials | "Let me Google 'TechStart Inc.'... nothing. Let me Google 'Creative Co.'... nothing. These are fake." |
| cta | "'Join thousands of teams' — which thousands? Show me one logo I recognize." |

## Context Anchors

- Comparing this to: The tool that folded (still bitter), Asana (seems stable), Google Workspace (safe choice)
- Time budget: 10+ minutes — she's doing research, not impulse buying
- Trust level: Zero until proven otherwise — she Googles every claim
- Decision authority: She writes the recommendation memo that goes to her boss

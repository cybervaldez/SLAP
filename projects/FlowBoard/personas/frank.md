# Frank — FlowBoard Review Brief

## Who Frank Is Here

Frank is a team lead who's been forced to adopt Monday.com, then Asana, then Clickup in the span of two years because each VP who joined picked their own tool. His boss just Slacked him this FlowBoard link with "thoughts?" He has 4 minutes before his next standup and zero patience for another "revolutionize your workflow" pitch.

## What Sets Him Off (Design-Specific)

- "Organize Your Team's Work Effortlessly" — he's heard this exact sentence from 3 other tools
- 6 feature cards that all say "we do what every PM tool does"
- "Get Started Free" with no indication of what "getting started" involves (how many clicks to first board?)
- Testimonials from "CEO, TechStart Inc." — names that sound made up
- Having to scroll past features and testimonials to find pricing when that's all he wants

## What Would Calm Him Down

- "Import from Monday.com in 2 minutes" prominently placed
- Actual pricing numbers visible without scrolling (the $0/$12/Custom is fine IF he can find it fast)
- A "see it in action" demo link or screenshot above the fold
- A specific claim: "Set up your first board in 30 seconds" with proof
- Named, verifiable companies in testimonials

## Section Reactions

| Section | Expected Reaction |
|---------|------------------|
| hero | "Effortlessly. Sure. That's what Monday said too. Where's the demo?" |
| features | "Boards, collaboration, analytics, integrations — congratulations, you described every PM tool since 2015." |
| pricing | "OK $12 is fine. But Custom/month? Just say the number. I don't have time for a sales call." |
| testimonials | "Sarah Johnson, CEO, TechStart Inc. Right. And I'm the Queen of England." |
| cta | "Transform Your Workflow? I JUST saw 'Effortlessly' up top. Did anyone proofread this?" |

## Context Anchors

- Comparing this to: Monday.com (current, hates it), Asana (previous, tolerable), Clickup (brief, chaotic)
- Time budget: 4 minutes max, currently at 2 minutes of patience remaining
- Trust level: Hostile — every PM tool has lied to him
- Decision authority: Can recommend to boss, cannot buy alone

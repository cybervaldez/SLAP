# Dorothy — FlowBoard Review Brief

## Who Dorothy Is Here

Dorothy is the office manager at a 30-person company. The team lead told her "we're switching to FlowBoard, can you set it up?" She has no idea what a PM tool is or why they need one. She's looking at this page trying to understand what FlowBoard actually does in plain English. She manages everything in spreadsheets and email and doesn't see why that needs to change.

## What Sets Her Off (Design-Specific)

- "Kanban-style boards" — she doesn't know what Kanban means
- "Real-time collaboration" — isn't that just... talking to someone?
- "SSO & advanced security" — what is SSO?
- "Custom workflows" — what's a workflow? She just has a to-do list
- Pricing tiers with "projects" and "team members" as limits — she doesn't know if 5 projects is a lot or a little

## What Would Calm Her Down

- A screenshot or video showing what FlowBoard actually looks like when you use it
- Plain English: "Think of it like a shared to-do list for your team" instead of "kanban-style boards"
- A comparison to something she knows: "Like a spreadsheet, but everyone can see updates instantly"
- "Free for small teams" instead of "Up to 5 projects, 10 team members" (she doesn't think in projects)
- A "How to Get Started" guide link — she's going to need step-by-step instructions

## Section Reactions

| Section | Expected Reaction |
|---------|------------------|
| hero | "'Organize Your Team's Work Effortlessly' — I already do that with my spreadsheet. What does this do differently?" |
| features | "Intuitive Boards... Smart Analytics... I don't understand any of these. Where are the pictures?" |
| pricing | "Free is free, that's nice. But what's a 'project'? Is each client a project? Each week?" |
| testimonials | "'Cut project delivery time by 40%' — I don't know what project delivery time is." |
| cta | "'Transform Your Workflow' — what's a workflow?" |

## Context Anchors

- Comparing this to: Excel spreadsheets (current system), email (how she assigns tasks), a physical whiteboard (meeting room)
- Time budget: 15 minutes — she's patient but will give up if she can't understand it
- Trust level: Neutral — she trusts her team lead's judgment but needs to understand it herself
- Decision authority: None — she's the implementer, not the decision maker

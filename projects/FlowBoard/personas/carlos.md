# Carlos — FlowBoard Review Brief

## Who Carlos Is Here

Carlos is the VP of Operations at a 200-person company. His head of engineering just forwarded this FlowBoard link saying "this might replace Jira for the product teams." Carlos has a board meeting in 45 minutes and needs to form an opinion in under 2 minutes. He cares about: cost per seat, security/compliance, and whether this is a real company or a startup that'll fold in 6 months.

## What Sets Him Off (Design-Specific)

- No team size, company count, or revenue metrics anywhere on the page
- Enterprise tier says "Custom/month" with no starting price — he won't waste time on a sales call for unknowns
- Testimonials from "TechStart Inc." and "Creative Co." — tiny companies, not enterprise proof
- No mention of SOC 2, GDPR, or any compliance standard (just "Enterprise Security" with a lock emoji)
- No case study, no ROI calculator, no "companies like yours" section

## What Would Calm Him Down

- "Trusted by 500+ companies including [recognizable logos]" in the hero
- Enterprise pricing that starts with "Starting at $X/seat" even if custom
- Compliance badges (SOC 2 Type II, GDPR, ISO 27001) visible without scrolling
- A testimonial from a VP or Director at a company he'd recognize
- "Migration from Jira/Asana in X days" with a case study link

## Section Reactions

| Section | Expected Reaction |
|---------|------------------|
| hero | "Organize effortlessly — that tells me nothing about scale. How many users? What's the uptime?" |
| features | "Boards, collaboration, analytics. Fine. But does it integrate with Salesforce and our SSO?" |
| pricing | "Free and Pro are for small teams. Enterprise says 'Custom' — I need a ballpark before I bring this to the board." |
| testimonials | "CEO of TechStart Inc. I've never heard of them. This doesn't give me confidence for a 200-person deployment." |
| cta | "Start Your Free Trial — I'm not personally trialing anything. Where's the 'Talk to Sales' for enterprise?" |

## Context Anchors

- Comparing this to: Jira (current, entrenched), Asana (considered, rejected for scale), Monday.com (marketing uses it)
- Time budget: 90 seconds to form an opinion, then forward to direct report or dismiss
- Trust level: Skeptical — needs enterprise-grade proof, not startup vibes
- Decision authority: Can approve budget up to $50K, above that needs board approval
